It's safe to operate, with no health risks to the end user. And it allows for local ownership to be operated either on or off the grid.

Solar energy can refer to a variety of technologies from solar hot water heating to solar ovens, but for purposes of today's session, we're going to talk about solar photovoltaic panels and solar electrical systems. How do you measure the sunlight in the community where you're working?"},{"type":"transcript","start":224,"author":{"name":"Frank Bergh","src":"http://theplatform-static.edgesuite.net/In_The_Telling/Frank_Bergh.png"},"annotation":"Solar insolation and radiation is measured in kilowatt-hours per square meter per day. This is a common unit that allows us to compare how much sunlight is incident upon land in different parts of the world over the course of the year, and how much energy would be produced by a solar photovoltaic system in that location."},{"type":"transcript","start":245,"author":{"name":"Frank Bergh","src":"http://theplatform-static.edgesuite.net/In_The_Telling/Frank_Bergh.png"},"annotation":"So when comparing sites in terms of solar energy potential, it's important to understand the difference between radiation and insolation. Radiation refers to the instantaneous amount of sunlight in a certain area, which will change over the course of the day. "},{"type":"transcript","start":259,"author":{"name":"Frank Bergh","src":"http://theplatform-static.edgesuite.net/In_The_Telling/Frank_Bergh.png"},"annotation":"Insolation, however, refers to the long-term energy potential in a given place. So we can measure insolation in kilowatt-hours per square meter per day; or per year; or over time to understand how consistently the sun shines in that location, and how much energy will be available to run a solar powered system. "},{"type":"transcript","start":277,"author":{"name":"Frank Bergh","src":"http://theplatform-static.edgesuite.net/In_The_Telling/Frank_Bergh.png"},"annotation":"So a question that's often asked in the communities where we work is, \"How does a solar panel work, anyways?\" The short answer is that it converts the energy from the sun's radiation into electricity (direct current), which can be stored on a battery or immediately used to power electrical devices."},{"type":"transcript","start":296,"author":{"name":"Frank Bergh","src":"http://theplatform-static.edgesuite.net/In_The_Telling/Frank_Bergh.png"},"annotation":"When making an initial investment in a solar energy system, it's important to optimize the positioning and configuration of the system relative to the sun so that over the life of the investment, we're maximizing energy output from the system."},{"type":"transcript","start":311,"author":{"name":"Frank Bergh","src":"http://theplatform-static.edgesuite.net/In_The_Telling/Frank_Bergh.png"},"annotation":"These design considerations include the panel's orientation to the sun; the tilt angle at which the panels are mounted; as well as potential considerations of tracking the sun's path over the course of the day on an East-West axis; or over the course of the year on a North-South axis. "},{"type":"transcript","start":331,"author":{"name":"Frank Bergh","src":"http://theplatform-static.edgesuite.net/In_The_Telling/Frank_Bergh.png"},"annotation":"One thing that's critical (especially for off-grid energy systems) is load assessment. Unlike in grid-connected systems (where the system is basically designed assuming constant and reliable access to electricity), in an off-grid system, we need to understand what we're trying to energize before we design and size-up the system as a whole."},{"type":"transcript","start":355,"author":{"name":"Frank Bergh","src":"http://theplatform-static.edgesuite.net/In_The_Telling/Frank_Bergh.png"},"annotation":"In 2009, I was working on a solar energy system at the Mason de Naissance, which is a birthing clinic in Torbeck, Haiti. We needed to have enough power to refrigerate medicine in the pharmacy as well as run medical tests in the lab. We also needed to run an ultrasound machine. "},{"type":"transcript","start":373,"author":{"name":"Frank Bergh","src":"http://theplatform-static.edgesuite.net/In_The_Telling/Frank_Bergh.png"},"annotation":"So in conducting a load assessment of the clinic, we needed to have baseline assumptions for how much energy is consumed by each of these devices when they're on, and how many hours per day the devices will be used. "},{"type":"transcript","start":386,"author":{"name":"Frank Bergh","src":"http://theplatform-static.edgesuite.net/In_The_Telling/Frank_Bergh.png"},"annotation":"We need to compare the usage information (the electrical demand) with the solar resource availability (the insolation that we discussed earlier). Once the engineers understand how much energy is being used, and how much sunlight is available, we can determine how many solar panels; how many batteries; and what size of connective equipment to use in the design and installation of an off-grid solar energy system."},{"type":"transcript","start":409,"author":{"name":"Frank Bergh","src":"http://theplatform-static.edgesuite.net/In_The_Telling/Frank_Bergh.png"},"annotation":"And that's why it's so important to conduct a disciplined load assessment prior to beginning design work of the energy system.
