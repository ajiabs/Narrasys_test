video seek events should wait for buffering before timeline starts playing


modal style should be an episode-level template choice


scene nav and search aren't picking up episode styles -- split them into color sets etc?

remove unneeded popup blocker stuff

Bill: Now that you have an LTI account, you should be able to see it.  I'm still seeing it.  Go into watch mode, let the timeline fade away completely.  Then, try to get it to come back without clicking the video (which pauses it and brings the timeline back).  I also notice that the video is being scaled to fit the width of the iframe in watch mode so the top and bottom get cropped and do a weird bouncy thing if you try to scroll them.  I would expect the video to scale without cropping, leaving space on the sides or top and bottom as appropriate.  Maybe the 2 things are related?



---- ABOVE IS NEED FOR 4.0 LAUNCH; BELOW IS FUTURE OR NICE TO HAVE ----

Bring back fullscreen mode (needs browser testing muchly)

Safari is still not working with youtube, either in desktop or ipad/phone. argh.  Diabled for now, reverting to mp4 version

for now: force all bg transitions to fade


youtube is failing to play some videos on firefox when  flash is not installed.  Niche problem, but needs an error message with a link to flash installer at least.   


iOS is still letting you drag the timeline outside the visible boundaries when the timeline is zoomed in (no longer can set values outside the playable range, though, so we've got that going for us which is nice)

player needs to watch for error states coming from youtube or the <video>, if possible.


Improve generic error handler


remove div=clear from end of items; they interfere with sidebars

preload images ahead of playhead? 

Better handling for end of episode
 
Find out why m3u8 was causing problems, fix it


ModelSvc may need to tweak episode data (ensure scenes are contiguous and non-overlapping, make sure items are all within scenes) (or just do this inside producer.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For USC:
credly item needs to notify event analytics on item enter; we can use that to capture "user reached end of ep" requirement
credly item needs to be able to handle multiple separate badges in one event (or should we just do sequential events?)

correct youtube urls into embeddable format

episodeMetrics (or a new endpoint) should log Story application errors, too -- with browser version, platform, etc if possible


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Future:

Youtube should work on iDevices and android. Doesn't. Fix that.

zooming timeline should reveal untitled scenes and (if zoomed far enough) items: don't have a separate MarkedEvents array


Ask Bill to add data fields: 
* episode: "friendly ID"  (for use in url).  Needs a lookup endpoint. Ideally per customer(?)
* Link events: noEmbed (for links with framebreakers)
* Link events: targetTop (for end-of-episode links to LTI host)


Consider eliminating fg panes other than windowFg (check existing episodes, are any using them?)
Treat windowFg items as content by default,  not cosmetic.

Instead maybe have fg panes for specific layouts with built-in styles? (modal)

Scenes: handle showTimeline layouts

sceneModifier events (as event plugin)

Scenes should detect when content panes (including their Fg and Bg) are empty, and adjust the layout to make up for it (better still, do this only if they're empty for more than n seconds...)  (maybe overkill; if we offer more scene template choices and make them easier to choose in authoring, we wont need to automate it)

"text" scenes:  no video; have a button at the end to start the next scene (landing screen could be a special case of this). Timeline shows this as a 'duration' proportional to the length of the page, and autoscrolls the page if you "play"


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SXS:
Build a demo analytics dashboard


Rewrite timelineSvc to better handle multiple episodes:
	Needs to be able to change the video source to a new episode (different video node? change source of single node? playlist?)
	Will also need to be able to capture analytics for episode time instead of timeline time...
	timelineSvc needs functions to translate episode->timeline time and vice versa


Add a "skip" type of event to allow skipping scenes


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Producer UI:  

clicking on a scene or item should highlight its duration in the timeline, with draggable handlebars


Producer nav:
Expand player's [watch]            | [discover] | [review]
					 into [transcribe] | [scene | content] | [review]

[transcribe] looks like watch mode, with text input where the captions field is, and a pulldown for speaker

			 extra controls above for adjusting the current transcript block's start / end times
					(moving the start time handle automatically skips the video to the new start time and plays a snippet)
					(moving the end time handle automatically plays the same length snippet *ending at* the new end time)
					display times of preceding and next transcript items too, if they exist, and an 'add' button:

					 {prev item } [this item starttime .... this item endtime] [add new item]   {next item }
					 (curlies just display previous item's start time (and end time if specified), next item's start time; click on a curly switches to that as the current item)
					 (square brackets are time input fields for editing the current item start and end times:  text plus slider)

				may have a side column to allow easier switching from one transcript node to another (not for direct editing though)

("scene" and "content" are unnamed-to-the-user toggles inside discover mode.)

[scene] edits the layout (scene template) and backgrounds for each pane and for the whole scene.

				Control panel above bottom toolbar -- right where the captions were again! Consistent! -- for scene template changes
				(before user can change anything here, prompt "edit the current layout or add a layout change here?") also a 'remove this layout')


				Clicking on a content pane brings up a list of all items in the pane in that scene, lets you set start/end times individually. 

[content] layer reveals the content items in the scene layout
					with an "add" button as the last item in each pane. 
					Click individual items to change their styling and content (in a modal)


[review] is just review mode where you can click on anything to edit it in a modal.  
					Add a 3rd column for cosmetic items if you want. Make that user toggleable if you want to get fancy.
