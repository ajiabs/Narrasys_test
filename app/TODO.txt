Templates: 
	Improve reviewMode templates (review-annotation and review-transmedia)
	Remaining link item templates
	sidebar, burst margin layouts need to be built into all scene templates

make windowBg and windowFg position:fixed

BUG: video is starting without timeline in iOS

For USC:
credly item needs to notify event analytics on item enter; we can use that to capture "user reached end of ep" requirement
credly item needs to be able to handle multiple separate badges in one event (or should we just do sequential events?)

iOS: fix hide/reveal events on bottom toolbar on touchscreens (currently it's never hiding)

ModelSvc needs to tweak episode data (ensure scenes are contiguous and non-overlapping, make sure items are all within scenes)

Video: youtube/safari is having some http vs https permissions issues when testing locally; may be fine on live server (since that is https too) but need to test...


add episode styles to navpanel, search, etc? (typography and color, most importantly)

Bottom toolbar:  finetune layout

build error display handler

app.js uses localStorage to find the login url if it gets 401 errors from the API.  TODO: handle cases where user data exists but localStorage doesn't (check Safari in "private browsing" mode for example)

bring back tiny-screen layout

Compare all scene and item templates to existing episodes for backwards compatibility....


---- ABOVE IS NEED FOR 4.0 LAUNCH; BELOW IS FUTURE OR NICE TO HAVE ----

Better handling for end of episode
 



Scenes should detect when content panes (including Fg and Bg) are empty, and adjust the layout to make up for it 
(better still, do this only if they're empty for more than n seconds...)


Ask Bill to add fields: "friendly ID" for episodes (for use in url)


Producer stuff: put an "add" button with ng-if="producer" in every fg, content, and bg pane


Consider eliminating fg panes other than windowFg (check existing episodes, are any using them?)


Build a demo analytics dashboard


Scenes: handle showTimeline layouts



Rewrite timelineSvc to better handle multiple episodes:
	Needs to be able to change the video source to a new episode (different video node? change source of single node? playlist?)
	Will also need to be able to capture analytics for episode time instead of timeline time...
	timelineSvc needs functions to translate episode->timeline time and vice versa


Add a "skip" type of event to allow skipping scenes


"text" scenes:  hide video and video controls altogether, have a button at the end to start the next scene (landing screen could be a special case of this)



sceneModifier events (as plugin)
