Tiny screens need to force review mode as the default

Error handler needs to distinguish between blockers and recoverable errors

player needs to watch for error states coming from youtube or the <video>, if possible.

CSS: need a default highlight style, make sure we have all of them 

iOS bug: timeline isn't waiting for video to finish buffering on first play in iOS
iOS: fix hide/reveal events on bottom toolbar on touchscreens (currently it's never hiding)
iOS: playhead is draggable past boundaries of timeline
iOS: watch mode isn't displaying at all(!)

ModelSvc needs to tweak episode data (ensure scenes are contiguous and non-overlapping, make sure items are all within scenes)

Bottom toolbar:  finetune layout

Bug: Chrome has autoscroll turned off when you enter review mode
Bug: Chrome is fighting manualscroll vs autoscroll

BUG: IE doesn't like timeline.html's "style='left:{{markerPercent(foo)}}'" stuff
BUG: IE: footer logo is wrong shape 
BUG: IE: direct clicks on the YT video are going to YT instead of our timeline....



Bug: item transitions: animating the height of items causes problems in Safari - decide if we need that effect anyway

add episode styles to navpanel, search, etc? (typography and color, most importantly)

app.js uses localStorage to find the login url if it gets 401 errors from the API.  TODO: handle cases where user data exists but localStorage doesn't (check Safari in "private browsing" mode for example)

Compare all scene and item templates to existing episodes for backwards compatibility....
in particular test link-youtube, embed-youtube, and link-embed

Have timeline run a very slow interval update of all item states, in case anythign gets stuck

youtube is failing to play some videos on firefox when  flash is not installed.  Niche problem, but needs an error message with a link to flash installer at least.   


---- ABOVE IS NEED FOR 4.0 LAUNCH; BELOW IS FUTURE OR NICE TO HAVE ----

for now: force all bg transitions to fade

remove div=clear from end of items; they interfere with sidebars

preload images ahead of playhead? 

Better handling for end of episode
 

For USC:
credly item needs to notify event analytics on item enter; we can use that to capture "user reached end of ep" requirement
credly item needs to be able to handle multiple separate badges in one event (or should we just do sequential events?)

correct youtube urls into embeddable format

episodeMetrics (or a new endpoint) should log Story application errors, too -- with browser version, platform, etc if possible

Find out why m3u8 was causing problems, fix it

Scenes should detect when content panes (including Fg and Bg) are empty, and adjust the layout to make up for it 
(better still, do this only if they're empty for more than n seconds...)

Ask Bill to add fields: 
* "friendly ID" for episodes (for use in url)
* noEmbed (for links with framebreakers)
* targetTop (for end-of-episode links to LTI host)

Producer stuff: put an "add" button with ng-if="producer" in every fg, content, and bg pane


Consider eliminating fg panes other than windowFg (check existing episodes, are any using them?)


Build a demo analytics dashboard


Scenes: handle showTimeline layouts



Rewrite timelineSvc to better handle multiple episodes:
	Needs to be able to change the video source to a new episode (different video node? change source of single node? playlist?)
	Will also need to be able to capture analytics for episode time instead of timeline time...
	timelineSvc needs functions to translate episode->timeline time and vice versa


Add a "skip" type of event to allow skipping scenes


"text" scenes:  hide video and video controls altogether, have a button at the end to start the next scene (landing screen could be a special case of this)



sceneModifier events (as plugin)
