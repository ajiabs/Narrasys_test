Add a 'play' icon to the video (esp when no poster is available)

Templates: Compare all item templates to existing episodes for backwards compatibility....
	Improve reviewMode templates (review-annotation and review-transmedia)
	Landing screen template(s)
	Remaining link item templates
	Episode templates

item layouts in content panes (sidebar, burst margins)


ModelSvc needs to tweak episode data (ensure scenes are contiguous and non-overlapping, make sure items are all within scenes)

For USC:
credly item needs to notify event analytics on item enter; we can use that to capture "user reached end of ep" requirement
credly item needs to be able to handle multiple separate badges in one event (or should we just do sequential events?)


Performance: bring back bind-once(?)
Performance: .item-animate and .item both have transition times, which causes laggy behavior on (at least) iPad.  Trouble is we need it on both due to the way ng-animate works.  v3 didn't have this problem, figure out why




iOS bug: matchVideoHeight isn't (always) working on scene enter -- may simply be performance related
bug: landing screen isn't always getting dismissed when help pane is dismissed
iOS bug: 'play' button isn't getting switched to 'pause' if user clicks on video to start
iOS: toolbars and window scroll not playing nicely together (position:fixed inside scrollable element...)
iOS: hide fullscreen button (and remove the #CONTAINER css that supports it, which will take care of the above...)
iOS: playhead and volume controls need to respond to touchstart, touchmove, touchend
CHROME: autoscroll not working 
iOS: fix hide/reveal events on bottom toolbar on touchscreens (currently it's never hiding)
iOS: scene nav menu can't be dismissed


Bottom toolbar:  finetune layout

build error display handler


Better handling for end of episode


Add keyboard commands (ESC to dismiss modals, SPACE to toggle play/pause, others?)

timeline seek should trigger autoscroll immediately
timeline seek should wait for video to buffer before starting timeline clock



app.js uses localStorage to find the login url if it gets 401 errors from the API.  TODO: handle cases where user data exists but localStorage doesn't (check Safari in "private browsing" mode for example)



Ask Bill to add fields:
"friendly ID" for episodes (for use in url)
landingScreen template for episode?  (no, instead  Producer should automatically add a landing screen scene at the beginning of an episode)





Producer stuff: put an "add" button with ng-if="producer" in every fg, content, and bg pane

Consider eliminating fg panes other than windowFg (check existing episodes, are any using them?)





Video: youtube/safari is having some http vs https permissions issues when testing locally; may be fine on live server (since that is https too) but need to test...





Rewrite timelineSvc to better handle multiple episodes (easiest way is probably to write timelineStart and End into each event...?)

Will also need to be able to capture analytics for episode time instead of timeline time...
timelineSvc needs functions to translate episode->timeline time and vice versa

Also for multiple eps: multiple video nodes? or change the src of existing video node? or a playlist?

Add a "skip" type of event to allow skipping scenes


Scenes: handle showTimeline layouts

"text" scenes:  hide video and video controls altogether, have a button at the end to start the next scene (landing screen could be a special case of this)


Build a demo analytics dashboard

sceneModifier events (as plugin)
