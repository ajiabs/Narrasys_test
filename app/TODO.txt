Add a 'play' icon to the video (esp when no poster is available)

Improve reviewMode templates (review-annotation and review-transmedia)

Landing screen template(s)

Remaining link item templates

Episode templates

item layouts in content panes (sidebar, burst margins)



Compare all item templates to existing episodes for backwards compatibility....


Bottom toolbar:  finetune layout


Add 'loading' UI to (at least) episode

Add keyboard commands (ESC to dismiss modals, SPACE to toggle play/pause, others?)

timeline seek should trigger autoscroll immediately


For USC:
credly item needs to notify event analytics on item enter; we can use that to capture "user reached end of ep" requirement
credly item needs to be able to handle multiple separate badges in one event (or should we just do sequential events?)


app.js uses localStorage to find the login url if it gets 401 errors from the API.  TODO: handle cases where user data exists but localStorage doesn't (check Safari in "private browsing" mode for example)



Ask Bill to add fields:
"friendly ID" for episodes (for use in url)
landingScreen template for episode?  (no, instead  Producer should automatically add a landing screen scene at the beginning of an episode)


Producer stuff: put an "add" button with ng-if="producer" in every fg, content, and bg pane

Consider eliminating fg panes other than windowFg (check existing episodes, are any using them?)




fix hide/reveal events on bottom toolbar on touchscreens (currently it's never hiding)

Video: youtube/safari is having some http vs https permissions issues when testing locally; may be fine on live server (since that is https too) but need to test...


build error display handler


Rewrite timelineSvc to better handle multiple episodes (easiest way is probably to write timelineStart and End into each event...?)

Will also need to be able to capture analytics for episode time instead of timeline time...
timelineSvc needs functions to translate episode->timeline time and vice versa

Also for multiple eps: multiple video nodes? or change the src of existing video node? or a playlist?

Add a "skip" type of event to allow skipping scenes


Scenes: handle showTimeline layouts

"text" scenes:  hide video and video controls altogether, have a button at the end to start the next scene (landing screen could be a special case of this)


Build a demo analytics dashboard

sceneModifier events (as plugin)
