For USC:
credly item needs to notify event analytics on item enter; we can use that to capture "user reached end of ep" requirement
credly item needs to be able to handle multiple separate badges in one event (or should we just do sequential events?)

Test badge event's use of localStorage data in cases where localStorage isn't present but user has legit login (if that even exists.  Safari in privacy mode?)


Improve reviewMode templates (review-annotation and review-transmedia)

Landing screen template

Remaining link item templates

Episode templates

item layouts in content panes (sidebar, burst margins)

timelineSvc is not recognizing all stop items...  debug!

Compare all item templates to existing episodes for backwards compatibility....


Help panel (and related cookie)

Bottom toolbar:  finetune layout





Ask Bill to add fields:
"friendly ID" for episodes (for use in url)
landingScreen template for episode?  (no, instead  Producer should automatically add a landing screen scene at the beginning of an episode)


Producer stuff: put an "add" button with ng-if="producer" in every fg, content, and bg pane


Consider eliminating fg panes other than windowFg (check existing episodes, are any using them?)




test hide/reveal events on bottom toolbar on touchscreens

Video: youtube/safari is having some permissions issues...


error display handler


Rewrite timelineSvc to better handle multiple episodes (easiest way is probably to write timelineStart and End into each event...?)

Will also need to be able to capture analytics for episode time instead of timeline time...
timelineSvc needs functions to translate episode->timeline time and vice versa

Also for multiple eps: multiple video nodes? or change the src of existing video node? or a playlist?

Add a "skip" type of event to allow skipping scenes


Scenes: handle showTimeline layouts


Build a demo analytics dashboard

sceneModifier events (as plugin)
