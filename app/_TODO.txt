changing into 'watch' mode needs to turn off 'search'

see how much of search's indexEvents can be moved into modelSvc and done once

editor shouldn't be zooming timeline... 


matchVideoHeight should be a directive, not part of scene setup

autoscroll should be a directive

block autoscroll when sort by type

search: links should link, images should modal
producer should see cosmetic items in search, marked as such
(use itt-item with forced template?)
