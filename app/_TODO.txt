changing view modes needs to turn off 'search'


editor shouldn't be zooming timeline... 


matchVideoHeight should be a directive, not part of scene setup

autoscroll should be a directive

block autoscroll when sort by type

search: links should link, images should modal
producer should see cosmetic items in search, marked as such
(use itt-item with forced template?)
