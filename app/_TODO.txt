sort out a better way to handle appstate.product and appstate.productloadedas
(appstate.uiversion?)

creating editor items while in search mode: items are sometimes sorted incorrectly

better handling for case where page loads in search mode initially

changing into 'watch' mode needs to turn off 'search'

searchresults needs to set isNarrow

matchVideoHeight should be a directive, not part of scene setup

autoscroll should be a directive

search results: sorted by type should use simplified but still functional template (searchresult.html with actual links etc)
