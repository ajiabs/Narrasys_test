sort out a better way to handle appstate.product and appstate.productloadedas
(appstate.uiversion?)

editor shouldn't be zooming timeline... 
creating editor items while in search mode: items are sometimes sorted incorrectly

better handling for case where page loads in search mode initially

changing into 'watch' mode needs to turn off 'search'






matchVideoHeight should be a directive, not part of scene setup

autoscroll should be a directive

search results: links should link, images should modal
