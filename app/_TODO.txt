sort out a better way to handle appstate.product and appstate.productloadedas
(appstate.uiversion?)


better handling for case where page loads in search mode initially

changing into 'watch' mode needs to turn off 'search'

see how much of search's indexEvents can be moved into modelSvc and done once

editor shouldn't be zooming timeline... 


matchVideoHeight should be a directive, not part of scene setup

autoscroll should be a directive

search results: links should link, images should modal
