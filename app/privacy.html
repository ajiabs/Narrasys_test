  <h1>NARRASYS Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>This policy describes what information Narrasys collects from our users, and how we use it.</p>

  <p>To get the important part out of the way first: we do not and have no plans to share personally identifiable
    information with any third parties for advertising or direct marketing purposes. Narrasys is not in the ad
    business.</p>

  <h2>Anonymous users</h2>

  <p>Narrasys collects some usage data from all users: we keep track how people use our episodes, which parts get
    skipped and which get rewatched, which outgoing links get clicked and which ones don't, and so forth. We use
    localStorage (a web browser feature similar to cookies) to keep track of repeat visits by the same user -- this
    is the only personally identifiable information we collect in episodes which allow anonymous access.</p>

  <p>We collect this information solely for the purpose of learning how we can best improve our product. We may
    eventually disclose aggregate reports based on this data, but do not and will not pass on individually
    identifiable information of this type to any third parties.</p>

  <h2>OAuth users</h2>

  <p>Some Narrative(s) require users to log in via OAuth in order to view the episode.</p>

  <p>OAuth is a protocol which allows you to access Narrative(s) using your existing login information from an OAuth
    provider (such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, or others), while giving you a degree of control of how much of
    that information we receive (we never get your password, for example.) The amount of information we receive from
    those authentication providers differs slightly depending on the provider; please see their respective privacy
    policies for more details.</p>

  <p>If you wish, you may opt out of this by selecting "None" when we ask which OAuth provider you wish to use; some
    features of these episodes will be disabled if you choose this option.</p>

  <p>A small number of Narrative(s) support "badges" or "achievements" -- for these episodes we keep track of your
    progress towards those "achievements". If (and only if) you choose to 'collect' an acheived badge, that
    information will be passed on to the third-party provider of that service (credly.com).</p>

  <p>Some episodes may also contain polls, quiz questions, and (in the near future) notes, discussion forums, and so
    forth; if you choose to use these features, we store and redisplay the information you enter as needed. (We may
    delete or modify inappropriate content entered via these features, at our discretion.)</p>

  <h2>LTI users</h2>

  <p>LTI stands for "Learning Tool Interoperability" -- if you're viewing a Narrative within a learning management
    system such as Blackboard or Canvas, LTI passes your identity from that system to ours so we're able to show you
    the episode without requiring you to log in again. (As with OAuth, we do not receive your password from
    LTI.)</p>

  <p>Narrative(s) which require LTI authentication are not accessible without LTI.</p>

  <p>If you are using a Narrative in an educational context, personally identifiable information about your usage of
    the episode (including your responses to quizzes, usage of links and discussion forums, and so on) may be shared
    with your instructor or others at your educational institution.</p>

  <h2>All users</h2>

  <p>We may disclose personal information if we are required by law or legal process to do so; to protect and defend
    our rights, services or property; or to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our service.</p>

  <p>This policy was written on July 14, 2014, and is subject to change at any time.</p>
