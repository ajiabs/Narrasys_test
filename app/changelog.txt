------------------------------------------------
Changes in v1.3.29:
nothing (I screwed up the tag in the last version)
------------------------------------------------

Error handling no longer overwrites the URL, has a proper controller now
Made logo bigger in EWB episode template (note that it scales based on window size, though....)
Added error message when authentication cookie fails and no return_to url is set
Force last scene to persist to end of video (Actual video duration doesn't always match what videojs.duration() claims, and different formats (mp4 vs m3u8 vs youtube) aren't always the same anyway)
Prevent error when items have no mime type in data (probably only occurs in local data, so harmless, but as long as I'm in here...)
Added sanity check to item directive, to catch crash-inducing authoring error

------------------------------------------------
Changes in v1.3.34:
Improving transmedia-image-fill template
Coercing existing instances of transmedia-image-plain in bg/fg/overlay to transmedia-image-fill instead
Added template inventory module for dev testing, and a superseekrit backdoor route to reach it
On second thought moved superseekrit back door into a separate code branch, it doesn't need to go live
transmedia-image-plain images are now clickable when in content pane; pops a modal automatically
Improved handling of item modals to make them easier to dismiss

corrected doubled scrollbar on firefox/chrome/IE iframes
Added transmedia-link-embed template, standardized handling of embedded iframes throughout
Ensure items with very short or zero duration don't get skipped by the cue point scheduler
correcting overflow on oversized windowFg stop media items
windowFg and stop items now work.

added GW episode template

------------------------------------------------

Adding background color to image modals (for partially transparent images)
New API data for master asset
iPhone and other small screens now default to explore mode, hide button for discover mode

------------------------------------------------
Changes in v1.4.1:
No longer need to wait for video to start playing before we render the playhead scene markers (get duration from API instead of directly from video)
fixed positioning bug in background-image items using the image-plain template
Use .webm when available (in firefox only)

------------------------------------------------

Don't try to use .webm when not available (fixing bug introduced in v1.4.1. Sigh)
------------------------------------------------
Changes in v1.4.4:
(attempting to) change video format priority: when browser supports both, try webm before m3u8 or mp4 (this may or may not work, videojs techOrder control doesn’t get this granular, but it can’t hurt)
ModelFactory now escapes spaces in asset urls

------------------------------------------------
Changes in v1.4.5:
masterAsset selection now handles multiple sizes of each filetype (and chooses the largest one.)  Also explicitly restricts m3u8 to Safari only.
The current tech order for the master video is:
	* youtube (if present, and not Safari, and not iPad)
	* webm (if supported by browser)
	* m3u8 (if Safari)
	* mp4
highlightSide and highlightBorder will no longer reposition the item
Embedded HTML is now supported in all title, description, and annotation fields.  Please to be using with care :)
