explore (and watch?) modes should be using their own item directive (which ignores templateUrl)


Landing screen template

Remaining link item templates

Episode templates

item layouts in content panes (sidebar, burst margins)


Compare all item templates to existing episodes for backwards compatibility....

Autoscroll in explore mode (and add to other scenes)

Help panel (and related cookie)

Bottom toolbar:
	icons for speed control, zoom controls
	finetune layout


Ask Bill to add fields:
"friendly ID" for episodes (for use in url)
landingScreen template for episode?  (no, instead  Producer should automatically add a landing screen scene at the beginning of an episode)


Producer stuff: put an "add" button with ng-if="producer" in every fg, content, and bg pane


Consider eliminating fg panes other than windowFg (check existing episodes, are any using them?)




test hide/reveal events on bottom toolbar on touchscreens

Video: youtube/safari is having some issues...


error display handler


BUG Rewrite timelineSvc to better handle multiple episodes (easiest way is probably to write timelineStart and End into each event...?)

Will also need to be able to capture analytics for episode time instead of timeline time...
timelineSvc needs functions to translate episode->timeline time and vice versa

Also for multiple eps: multiple video nodes? or change the src of existing video node? or a playlist?


Add a "skip" type of event to allow skipping scenes


Scenes: handle showTimeline layouts


Build a demo analytics dashboard

sceneModifier events (as plugin)
