For USC:
Plugin event type (quiz) try out a sample or two



first do:
Landing screen template
Remaining item templates
(esp. test stop items)
Remaining CSS

Episode templates





Ask Bill to add fields:
"friendly ID" for episodes
landingScreen template for episode?  (Or instead should Producer automatically add a landing screen scene at the beginning of an ep?)

explore (and watch?) modes should be using their own item directive (which ignores templateUrl)


Producer stuff: put an "add" button with ng-if="producer" in every fg, content, and bg pane

Help panel (and related cookie)

Consider eliminating fg panes (check existing episodes, are any using them?)


Bottom toolbar:
	icons for speed control, zoom controls
	finetune layout
	CC buttons

Autoscroll in explore mode (and add to other scenes)

Hide/reveal toolbar(s)

Also for multiple eps: multiple video nodes? or change the src of existing video node? or a playlist?

Add a "skip" type of event to allow skipping scenes

Scenes: handle showTimeline layouts


Build a demo analytics dashboard

sceneModifier events (as plugin)
