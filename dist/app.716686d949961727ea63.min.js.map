Negative numbers don't make sense for a\npie chart, and have unpredictable results.  The values do NOT need to be\npassed in as percentages; the plugin will calculate the total and per-slice\npercentages internally.\n\n* Created by Brian Medendorp\n\n* Updated with contributions from btburnett3, Anthony Aragues and Xavi Ivars\n\nThe plugin supports these options:\n\n\tseries: {\n\t\tpie: {\n\t\t\tshow: true/false\n\t\t\tradius: 0-1 for percentage of fullsize, or a specified pixel length, or 'auto'\n\t\t\tinnerRadius: 0-1 for percentage of fullsize or a specified pixel length, for creating a donut effect\n\t\t\tstartAngle: 0-2 factor of PI used for starting angle (in radians) i.e 3/2 starts at the top, 0 and 2 have the same result\n\t\t\ttilt: 0-1 for percentage to tilt the pie, where 1 is no tilt, and 0 is completely flat (nothing will show)\n\t\t\toffset: {\n\t\t\t\ttop: integer value to move the pie up or down\n\t\t\t\tleft: integer value to move the pie left or right, or 'auto'\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\tstroke: {\n\t\t\t\tcolor: any hexidecimal color value (other formats may or may not work, so best to stick with something like '#FFF')\n\t\t\t\twidth: integer pixel width of the stroke\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\tlabel: {\n\t\t\t\tshow: true/false, or 'auto'\n\t\t\t\tformatter:  a user-defined function that modifies the text/style of the label text\n\t\t\t\tradius: 0-1 for percentage of fullsize, or a specified pixel length\n\t\t\t\tbackground: {\n\t\t\t\t\tcolor: any hexidecimal color value (other formats may or may not work, so best to stick with something like '#000')\n\t\t\t\t\topacity: 0-1\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\tthreshold: 0-1 for the percentage value at which

color value (other formats may or may not work, so best to stick with something like '#CCC'), if null, the plugin will automatically use the color of the first slice to be combined\n\t\t\t\tlabel: any

Negative numbers don't make sense for a\npie chart, and have unpredictable results.  The values do NOT need to be\npassed in as percentages; the plugin will calculate the total and per-slice\npercentages internally.\n\n* Created by Brian Medendorp\n\n* Updated with contributions from

length, or 'auto'\n\t\t\tinnerRadius: 0-1 for percentage of fullsize or a specified pixel length, for creating a donut effect\n\t\t\tstartAngle: 0-2 factor of PI used for starting angle (in radians) i.e 3/2 starts at the top, 0 and 2 have the same result\n\t\t\ttilt: 0-1 for percentage to tilt the pie, where 1 is no tilt, and 0 is completely flat (nothing will show)\n\t\t\toffset: {\n\t\t\t\ttop: integer value to move the pie up or down\n\t\t\t\tleft: integer value to move the pie left or right, or 'auto'\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\tstroke: {\n\t\t\t\tcolor: any hexidecimal color value (other formats may

before it can safely handle more than one episode at a time:\n stepEvent (and probably other things too) currently depends on video time matching timeline time;\n we'll need to have a way to calculate one from the other (which will get especially complicated when\n we allow skipping scenes in SxS...)\n\n\n keeps an sorted-by-time array of timed events.\n Events are (item/scene id) enter or exit, (timeline) pause or play\n\n There are two separate loops here:\n clock() just updates appState.time on a tight interval, purely for time display.\n stepEvent() runs on a slower interval, watches the current video's reported current time,\n and handles any events since it was last called.  If one of them is\n a stop event, it will 'rewind' the timeline to that time (and stop handling events past it.)\n\n appState.time is the current playhead position\n timeMultiplier is the playback speed. No negative values or zero.\n\n\n injectEvents(events, t) receives a list of timed events (i.e. an episode) to be injected into the timeline at a given point.\n For now that point has to be zero.
