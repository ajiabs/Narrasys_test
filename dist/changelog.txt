------------------------------------------------
Changes in v1.3.27:
apiDataBaseUrl now optional
use m3u8 files instead of mp4
clicking an inline item detail now pauses the video
uncorrected a not-typo in vjs
removed pointer events from video poster to allow the safari powersaver plugin warning to appear
EWP episode template
Removed window autoscroll from explore mode (for now)
------------------------------------------------
Changes in v1.3.28:
Fixed missing protocol in apiDataBaseUrl
------------------------------------------------
Changes in v1.3.29:
nothing (I screwed up the tag in the last version)
------------------------------------------------
Changes in v1.3.30:
more background/foreground fill options
External links need to pause video too
Added control to toggle closed captions on and off in "watch" mode
------------------------------------------------
Changes in v1.3.31:
(possibly) reducing memory footprint in scene model
------------------------------------------------
Changes in v1.3.32:
Throttling cuepoint scan interval
misc performance improvements
Using bindonce on items to reduce number of variable watchers
------------------------------------------------
Changes in v1.3.33:
Error handling no longer overwrites the URL, has a proper controller now
Made logo bigger in EWB episode template (note that it scales based on window size, though....)
Added error message when authentication cookie fails and no return_to url is set
Force last scene to persist to end of video (Actual video duration doesn't always match what videojs.duration() claims, and different formats (mp4 vs m3u8 vs youtube) aren't always the same anyway)
Prevent error when items have no mime type in data (probably only occurs in local data, so harmless, but as long as I'm in here...)
Added sanity check to item directive, to catch crash-inducing authoring error

------------------------------------------------
Changes in v1.3.34:
Improving transmedia-image-fill template
Coercing existing instances of transmedia-image-plain in bg/fg/overlay to transmedia-image-fill instead
Added template inventory module for dev testing, and a superseekrit backdoor route to reach it
On second thought moved superseekrit back door into a separate code branch, it doesn't need to go live
transmedia-image-plain images are now clickable when in content pane; pops a modal automatically
Improved handling of item modals to make them easier to dismiss

------------------------------------------------
Changes in v1.3.35:
corrected doubled scrollbar on firefox/chrome/IE iframes
Added transmedia-link-embed template, standardized handling of embedded iframes throughout
Ensure items with very short or zero duration don't get skipped by the cue point scheduler
correcting overflow on oversized windowFg stop media items
windowFg and stop items now work.
Added indicator to let users know images can be zoomed (in the increasingly misnamed transmedia-image-plain template)
Fixed clipping of large images in transmedia-image-fill template
