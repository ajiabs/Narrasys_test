Negative numbers don't make sense for a\npie chart, and have unpredictable results.  The values do NOT need to be\npassed in as percentages; the plugin will calculate the total and per-slice\npercentages internally.\n\n* Created by Brian Medendorp\n\n* Updated with contributions from btburnett3, Anthony Aragues and Xavi Ivars\n\nThe plugin supports these options:\n\n\tseries: {\n\t\tpie: {\n\t\t\tshow: true/false\n\t\t\tradius: 0-1 for percentage of fullsize, or a specified pixel length, or 'auto'\n\t\t\tinnerRadius: 0-1 for percentage of fullsize or a specified pixel length, for creating a donut effect\n\t\t\tstartAngle: 0-2 factor of PI used for starting angle (in radians) i.e 3/2 starts at the top, 0 and 2 have the same result\n\t\t\ttilt: 0-1 for percentage to tilt the pie, where 1 is no tilt, and 0 is completely flat (nothing will show)\n\t\t\toffset: {\n\t\t\t\ttop: integer value to move the pie up or down\n\t\t\t\tleft: integer value to move the pie left or right, or 'auto'\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\tstroke: {\n\t\t\t\tcolor: any hexidecimal color value (other formats may or may not work, so best to stick with something like '#FFF')\n\t\t\t\twidth: integer pixel width of the stroke\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\tlabel: {\n\t\t\t\tshow: true/false, or 'auto'\n\t\t\t\tformatter:  a user-defined function that modifies the text/style of the label text\n\t\t\t\tradius: 0-1 for percentage of fullsize, or a specified pixel length\n\t\t\t\tbackground: {\n\t\t\t\t\tcolor: any hexidecimal color value (other formats may or may not work, so best to stick with something like '#000')\n\t\t\t\t\topacity: 0-1\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\tthreshold: 0-1 for the percentage value at which

color value (other formats may or may not work, so best to stick with something like '#CCC'), if null, the plugin will automatically use the color of the first slice to be combined\n\t\t\t\tlabel: any

Negative numbers don't make sense for a\npie chart, and have unpredictable results.  The values do NOT need to be\npassed in as percentages; the plugin will calculate the total and per-slice\npercentages internally.\n\n* Created by Brian Medendorp\n\n* Updated with contributions from

length, or 'auto'\n\t\t\tinnerRadius: 0-1 for percentage of fullsize or a specified pixel length, for creating a donut effect\n\t\t\tstartAngle: 0-2 factor of PI used for starting angle (in radians) i.e 3/2 starts at the top, 0 and 2 have the same result\n\t\t\ttilt: 0-1 for percentage to tilt the pie, where 1 is no tilt, and 0 is completely flat (nothing will show)\n\t\t\toffset: {\n\t\t\t\ttop: integer value to move the pie up or down\n\t\t\t\tleft: integer value to move the pie left or right, or 'auto'\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\tstroke: {\n\t\t\t\tcolor: any hexidecimal color value (other formats may
