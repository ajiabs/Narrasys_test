# In The Telling Player 3

## Running Locally

The app/index.html file should be served from a local webserver to a local browser or device, as attempting to load it from the filesystem directly to a browser will cause problems.

* You may setup your own webserver
* You may use the included node.js webserver (you will also need node to run unit tests)

### Node.js Method Instructions

* If needed, first install node.js:
	* [Instructions for Ubuntu](https://github.com/gtczap/node-install-ubuntu)
* Execute the following command from the root project/repo directory:
	* `node ./scripts/web-server.js` (Run this process in the background if you prefer)
* Navigate your browser to `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`


## Unit Tests

### Dependencies

The unit tests use [jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) and [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io). Karma runs on Node.js and can be installed via the Node Package Manager (NPM) after node has been installed.

* If needed, first install node.js:
	* [Instructions for Ubuntu](https://github.com/gtczap/node-install-ubuntu)
* Install Karma via NPM:
	`sudo npm install -g karma`

### Running the Tests

* start `scripts/test.sh` (on windows: `scripts\test.bat`)
  * a browser will start and connect to the Karma server (Chrome is default browser, others can be captured by loading the same url as the one in Chrome or by changing the `config/karma.conf.js` file)
* if you keep the tests running as you develop, they will automatically be re-run every time something in the file system changes


## End-to-End Tests

**Currently no E2E tests have been staged**

Angular ships with a baked-in end-to-end test runner that understands angular, your app and allows
you to write your tests with jasmine-like BDD syntax.

Requires a webserver, node.js + `./scripts/web-server.js` or your backend server that hosts the angular static files.

Check out the
[end-to-end runner's documentation](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/dev_guide.e2e-testing) for more
info.

* create your end-to-end tests in `test/e2e/scenarios.js`
* serve your project directory with your http/backend server or node.js + `scripts/web-server.js`
* to run do one of:
  * open `http://localhost:port/test/e2e/runner.html` in your browser
  * run the tests from console with [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) via
    `scripts/e2e-test.sh` or `script/e2e-test.bat`
