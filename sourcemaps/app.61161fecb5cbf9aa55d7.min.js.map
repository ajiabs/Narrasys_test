The exported methods of the playbackService are called by timelineSvc or ittVideo directive.\n *\n * Videos in the app (either the main video or embeds) are kept track of using the db record _id.

of a rewrite before it can safely handle more than one episode at a time:\n stepEvent (and probably other things too) currently depends on video time matching timeline time;\n we'll need to have a way to calculate one from the other (which will get especially complicated when\n we allow skipping scenes in SxS...)\n\n\n keeps an sorted-by-time array of timed events.\n Events are (item/scene id) enter or exit, (timeline) pause or play\n\n There are two separate loops here:\n clock() just updates appState.time on a tight interval, purely for time display.\n stepEvent() runs on a slower interval, watches the current video's reported current time,\n and handles any events since it was last called.  If one of them is\n a stop event, it will 'rewind' the timeline to that time (and stop handling events past it.)\n\n appState.time is the current playhead position\n timeMultiplier is the playback speed. No negative values or zero.\n\n\n injectEvents(events, t) receives a list of timed events (i.e. an episode) to be injected into the timeline at a given point.\n For now that point has to be zero. In future this will support injecting episodes inside of other episodes.\n\n TODO: support sequential episodes\n TODO: support injecting into the middle of an episode\n TODO: have a way to delete a portion of the timeline (so sXs users can skip scenes)\n\n timeline ending sequence:\n -do no wait for video to emit and 'ended' event\n -manually signal an ending sequence upon entering the endingscreen's enter event detected in stepEvent\n sequence\n\n -> ending screen entered -> timelineSvc#_doEndingSequence -> on 'ended' event emitted from player, set time to the duration\n\n note: ending screen can be entered naturally as the video progresses or from seeking,\n either from the timeline or the next scene arrow\n */\n/* tslint:enable */\nimport {IEvent} from '../../../models';\nimport { config } from '../../../../config';\ninterface ITimelineEvent {\n  t: number;\n  id: string;\n  eventId?: string;\n  action: 'enter' | 'exit' | 'pause' | 'play' | 'preload';\n}\n\ninterface IDisplayMarkedEvent {\n  events: ITimelineEvent[];\n  layoutChange: boolean;\n  multiStop: boolean;\n  start_time: string;\n  stop: boolean;\n  toolTipText: string;\n}\n\nexport interface ITimelineSvc {\n  timelineEvents: ITimelineEvent[];\n  markedEvents: IEvent[];\n  displayMarkedEvents: IDisplayMarkedEvent[];\n  enforceSingletonPauseListener: boolean;\n  setSpeed(speed: number): void;\n  restartEpisode(): void;\n  play(): void;\n  pause(nocapture?: boolean): void;\n  startAtSpecificTime(t: number): void;\n  seek(t: number, method?: string, eventId?: string): void;\n  nextScene(): void;\n  handleScene(index: number, action: string): void;\n  prevScene(): void;\n  toggleMute(): void;\n  setVolume(vol: number): void;\n  init(episodeId: string): void;\n  injectEvents(events: any[], injectionTime?: number): void;\n  removeEvent(removeId: string): void;\n  updateEventTimes(event: any): void;\n  updateSceneTimes(episodeId: string): void;\n  sortTimeline(): void;\n  updateEventStates(): void;\n}\n/* tslint:disable */\ntimelineSvc.$inject = ['$window', '$timeout', '$interval', '$filter', 'modelSvc', 'appState', 'analyticsSvc', 'playbackService', 'ittUtils'];\n\nexport default function timelineSvc($window, $timeout, $interval, $filter, modelSvc, appState, analyticsSvc, playbackService, ittUtils) {\n  /* tslint:enable */\n  /* tslint:disable:prefer-const */\n  var svc: ITimelineSvc = Object.create(null);\n\n  svc.timelineEvents = [];\n  // each entry consists of {t:n, id:eventID|timeline, action:enter|exit|pause|play}.

away from.\n episodeEnd\t\t\t\t\ttriggered when user reaches end of episode\n play\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttriggered when user hits play\n pause\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttriggered when user hits pause\n seek\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttriggered whenever user changes the playhead position.\n seekFrom:\ttimestamp of origin\n method:\t\t\"scrubTimeline\", \"sceneMenu\", \"nextScene\", \"prevScene\", \"clickedOnEvent\".\n eventID:\tinclude if method was \"clickedOnEvent\"\n modeChange\t\t\t\t\ttriggered when episode is loaded (since default isn't always the same), and on user changes of mode\n mode: \"watch\",\"discover\",\"review\"\n playbackRateChange\ttriggered when user changes the playback speed\n playbackRate: 1\n stall\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttriggered when video playback stalls unintentionally\n lowBandwidth\t\t\t\ttriggered when we switch to a lower-bandwidth video stream due to too many stall events\n search (TODO)\t\t\t\t(search is incremental, so will have to think about how/when to capture this)\n\n event activity: captures interaction with specific transmedia items (\"events\").\n Different types of event can define their own interactions, but the core ones will be\n viewed\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplayer reached the event's start_time by any method\n interacted\t\t\t\t\tuser clicked a transmedia link, for example\n completed\t\t\t\t\t\tup to the transmedia item to
