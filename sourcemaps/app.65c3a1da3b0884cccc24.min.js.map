jQuery (.find())\n - depends on magic classNames 'cur' and 'ittTab'\n - depends on the directive user to keep track of tabindex :P\n\n TODO: allow different html layouts in ittTab (right now this is just for the producer edit pane)\n\n *** this is now deprecated **\n How to use:\n\n <div class=\"ittTabs\" itt-tabs>\n <div class=\"ittTab\" itt-tab=\"tabs[0]\" x-tabindex=\"0\" x-tablabel=\"Label 1\">\n Tab contents 1\n </div>\n <div class=\"ittTab cur\" itt-tab=\"tabs[1]\" x-tabindex=\"1\" x-tablabel=\"Label 2\">\n Tab contents 2 (Note that you can force this to start as the visible tab by giving it class 'cur')\n </div>\n <div class=\"ittTab\" itt-tab=\"tabs[2]\" x-tabindex=\"2\" x-tablabel=\"Label 3\">\n Tab contents 3\n </div>\n </div>\n\n *** new Example **\n improvements:\n - directive user does not need to keep track of tab index.\n - no jQuery dep.\n - still uses cur css class to style selected tab label.\n <itt-tabs>\n <itt-tab title=\"title 1\"> contents </itt-tab>\n <itt-tab title=\"title 2\"> contents </itt-tab>\n <itt-tab title=\"title 3\"> contents </itt-tab>\n </itt-tabs>\n\n */\nfunction ittTabs() {\n    return {\n        template: [\n            '<div class=\"\">',\n            '\t<ul class=\"nav nav-tabs\">',\n            '\t\t<li ng-repeat=\"pane in panes\" class=\"tab-pane\"><p class=\"ittTabLabel\" ng-class=\"{cur:pane.selected}\" ng-click=\"select(pane)\">{{pane.title}}</p></li>',\n            '\t</ul>',\n            '\t<div class=\"tab-content\"><ng-transclude></ng-transclude></div>',\n            '</div>'\n        ].join(''),\n        transclude: true,\n        restrict: 'EA',\n        scope: {},\n        controller: ['$scope', function ($scope) {\n                var panes = $scope.panes = [];\n                $scope.select = select;\n                var ctrl = this;\n                function select(pane) {\n                    angular.forEach(panes, function (p) {\n                        p.selected = false;\n                    });\n                    pane.selected = true;\n                }\n                ctrl.addPane = function addPane(pane) {\n                    if (panes.length === 0) {\n                        select(pane);\n                    }\n                    panes.push(pane);\n                };\n            }]\n    };\n}\n\n// CONCATENATED MODULE: ./app/scripts/directives/ittTab.ts\n/**\n * Created by githop on 3/30/17.\n */\nfunction ittTab() {\n    return {\n        template: '<div ng-show=\"selected\"><ng-transclude></ng-transclude></div>',\n        require: '^^ittTabs',\n        transclude: true,\n        scope: {\n            title: '@'\n        },\n        link: function (scope, elm, attrs, tabsCtrl) {\n            tabsCtrl.addPane(scope);\n        }\n    };\n}\n\n// CONCATENATED MODULE: ./app/scripts/directives/ittTemplateSelect.ts\n\nvar ittTemplateSelect_TEMPLATE = \"\\n<div class=\\\"field\\\" ng-if=\\\"$ctrl.isVisible\\\">\\n\\t<div class=\\\"label\\\">{{$ctrl.labelText}}</div>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"input\\\" ng-class=\\\"{layouts: $ctrl.labelText === 'Template' && $ctrl.data.producerItemType === 'scene'}\\\">\\n\\t\\t<select\\n\\t\\t  ng-if=\\\"$ctrl.context === 'event'\\\"\\n\\t\\t  ng-model=\\\"$ctrl.data.templateUrl\\\"\\n\\t\\t  ng-change=\\\"$ctrl.onSelectChange($ctrl.data, $ctrl.itemForm)\\\"\\n\\t\\t  ng-options=\\\"option.url as option.name for option in $ctrl.data.templateOpts\\\"\\n\\t\\t  np-options-disabled=\\\"option.isDisabled for option in $ctrl.data.templateOpts\\\">\\n    </select>\\n    \\n    <select\\n      ng-if=\\\"$ctrl.context === 'episode'\\\"\\n\\t\\t  ng-model=\\\"$ctrl.data.template_id\\\"\\n\\t\\t  ng-change=\\\"$ctrl.onEpisodeTemplateChange()\\\"\\n\\t\\t  ng-options=\\\"option.id as option.name for option in $ctrl.data.templateOpts\\\">\\n    </select>\\n\\t</div>\\n</div>\";\nvar ittTemplateSelect_TemplateSelectController = (function () {\n    function TemplateSelectController(selectService, modelSvc) {\n        this.selectService = selectService;\n        this.modelSvc = modelSvc;\n        this.labelText = 'Template';\n        this.context = 'event';\n        //\n    }\n    TemplateSelectController.prototype.$onInit = function () {\n        this.isAnnotation = this.data instanceof IAnnotation;\n        this.isEpisode = this.data instanceof IEpisode;\n        if (this.data instanceof IEpisode) {\n            this.context = 'episode';\n        }\n        if (this.isAnnotation) {\n            var currentScene = this.selectService.getSceneName(this.modelSvc.scene(this.data.scene_id));\n            var isCenterVV = currentScene === 'centerVV';\n            var isMondrian = currentScene === 'centerVVMondrian';\n            //remove H1s for certain layouts -

controls.\n\n This needs a bit of a rewrite before it can safely handle more than one episode at a time:\n stepEvent (and probably other things too) currently depends on video time matching timeline time;\n we'll need to have a way to calculate one from the other (which will get especially complicated when\n we allow skipping scenes in SxS...)\n\n\n keeps an sorted-by-time array of timed events.\n Events are (item/scene id) enter or exit, (timeline) pause or play\n\n There are two separate loops here:\n clock() just updates appState.time on a tight interval, purely for time display.\n stepEvent() runs on a slower interval, watches the current video's reported current time,\n and handles any events since it was last called.  If one of them is\n a stop event, it will 'rewind' the timeline to that time (and stop handling events past it.)\n\n appState.time is the current playhead position\n timeMultiplier is the playback speed. No negative values or zero.\n\n\n injectEvents(events, t) receives a list of timed events (i.e. an episode) to be injected into the timeline at a given point.\n For now that point has to be zero. In future this will support injecting episodes inside of other episodes.\n\n TODO: support sequential episodes\n TODO: support injecting into the middle of an episode\n TODO: have a way to delete a portion of the timeline (so sXs users can skip scenes)\n\n timeline ending sequence:\n -do no wait for video to emit and 'ended' event\n -manually signal an ending sequence upon entering the endingscreen's enter event detected in stepEvent\n sequence\n\n -> ending screen entered -> timelineSvc#_doEndingSequence -> on 'ended' event emitted from player, set time to the duration\n\n note: ending screen can be entered naturally as the video progresses or from seeking,\n either from the timeline or the next scene arrow\n */\n/* tslint:enable */\nimport {IEvent} from '../../models';\ninterface ITimelineEvent {\n  t: number;\n  id: string;\n  eventId?: string;\n  action: 'enter' | 'exit' | 'pause' | 'play' | 'preload';\n}\n\ninterface IDisplayMarkedEvent {\n  events: ITimelineEvent[];\n  layoutChange: boolean;\n  multiStop: boolean;\n  start_time: string;\n  stop: boolean;\n  toolTipText: string;\n}\n\nexport interface ITimelineSvc {\n  timelineEvents: ITimelineEvent[];\n  markedEvents: IEvent[];\n  displayMarkedEvents: IDisplayMarkedEvent[];\n  enforceSingletonPauseListener: boolean;\n  setSpeed(speed: number): void;\n  restartEpisode(): void;\n  play(): void;\n  pause(nocapture?: boolean): void;\n  startAtSpecificTime(t: number): void;\n  seek(t: number, method?: string, eventId?: string): void;\n  nextScene(): void;\n  handleScene(index: number, action: string): void;\n  prevScene(): void;\n  toggleMute(): void;\n  setVolume(vol: number): void;\n  init(episodeId: string): void;\n  injectEvents(events: any[], injectionTime?: number): void;\n  removeEvent(removeId: string): void;\n  updateEventTimes(event: any): void;\n  updateSceneTimes(episodeId: string): void;\n  sortTimeline(): void;\n  updateEventStates(): void;\n}\n\n/* tslint:disable */\ntimelineSvc.$inject = ['$window', '$timeout', '$interval', '$filter', 'config', 'modelSvc', 'appState', 'analyticsSvc', 'playbackService', 'ittUtils'];\n\nexport default function timelineSvc($window, $timeout, $interval, $filter, config, modelSvc, appState, analyticsSvc, playbackService, ittUtils) {\n  /* tslint:enable */\n  /* tslint:disable:prefer-const */\n  var svc: ITimelineSvc = Object.create(null);\n\n  svc.timelineEvents = [];\n  // each entry consists of {t:n, id:eventID|timeline, action:enter|exit|pause|play}.
