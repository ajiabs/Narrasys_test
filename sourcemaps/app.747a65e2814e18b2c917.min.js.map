away from.\n episodeEnd\t\t\t\t\ttriggered when user reaches end of episode\n play\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttriggered when user hits play\n pause\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttriggered when user hits pause\n seek\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttriggered whenever user changes the playhead position.\n seekFrom:\ttimestamp of origin\n method:\t\t\"scrubTimeline\", \"sceneMenu\", \"nextScene\", \"prevScene\", \"clickedOnEvent\".\n eventID:\tinclude if method was \"clickedOnEvent\"\n modeChange\t\t\t\t\ttriggered when episode is loaded (since default isn't always the same), and on user changes of mode\n mode: \"watch\",\"discover\",\"review\"\n playbackRateChange\ttriggered when user changes the playback speed\n playbackRate: 1\n stall\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttriggered when video playback stalls unintentionally\n lowBandwidth\t\t\t\ttriggered when we switch to a lower-bandwidth video stream due to too many stall events\n search (TODO)\t\t\t\t(search is incremental, so will have to think about how/when to capture this)\n\n event activity: captures interaction with specific transmedia items (\"events\").\n Different types of event can define their own interactions, but the core ones will be\n viewed\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplayer reached the event's start_time by any method\n interacted\t\t\t\t\tuser clicked a transmedia link, for example\n completed\t\t\t\t\t\tup to the transmedia item to
