magic classNames 'cur' and 'ittTab'\n - depends on the directive user to keep track of tabindex :P\n\n TODO: allow different html layouts in ittTab (right now this is just for the producer edit pane)\n\n *** this is now deprecated **\n How to use:\n\n <div class=\"ittTabs\" itt-tabs>\n <div class=\"ittTab\" itt-tab=\"tabs[0]\" x-tabindex=\"0\" x-tablabel=\"Label 1\">\n Tab contents 1\n </div>\n <div class=\"ittTab cur\" itt-tab=\"tabs[1]\" x-tabindex=\"1\" x-tablabel=\"Label 2\">\n Tab contents 2 (Note that you can force this to start as the visible tab by giving it class 'cur')\n </div>\n <div class=\"ittTab\" itt-tab=\"tabs[2]\" x-tabindex=\"2\" x-tablabel=\"Label 3\">\n Tab contents 3\n </div>\n </div>\n\n *** new Example **\n improvements:\n - directive user does not need

Negative numbers don't make sense for a\npie chart, and have unpredictable results.  The values do NOT need to be\npassed in as percentages; the plugin will calculate the total and per-slice\npercentages internally.\n\n* Created by Brian Medendorp\n\n* Updated with contributions from

length, or 'auto'\n\t\t\tinnerRadius: 0-1 for percentage of fullsize or a specified pixel length, for creating a donut effect\n\t\t\tstartAngle: 0-2 factor of PI used for starting angle (in radians) i.e 3/2 starts at the top, 0 and 2 have the same result\n\t\t\ttilt: 0-1 for percentage to tilt the pie, where 1 is no tilt, and 0 is completely flat (nothing will show)\n\t\t\toffset: {\n\t\t\t\ttop: integer value to move the pie up or down\n\t\t\t\tleft: integer value to move the pie left or right, or 'auto'\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\tstroke: {\n\t\t\t\tcolor: any hexidecimal color value (other formats may or may not work, so best to stick with something like '#FFF')\n\t\t\t\twidth: integer pixel width of the stroke\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\tlabel: {\n\t\t\t\tshow: true/false, or 'auto'\n\t\t\t\tformatter:  a user-defined function that modifies the text/style of the label text\n\t\t\t\tradius: 0-1 for percentage of fullsize, or a specified pixel length\n\t\t\t\tbackground: {\n\t\t\t\t\tcolor: any

REWRITE THIS CODE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!\n\n\t\t\t// When combining smaller slices into an 'other' slice, we need to\n\t\t\t// add a new series.  Since Flot gives plugins no way to modify the\n\t\t\t// list of series, the pie plugin uses a hack where the first call\n\t\t\t// to processDatapoints results in a call to setData with the new\n\t\t\t// list of series, then subsequent processDatapoints do nothing.\n\n\t\t\t// The plugin-global 'processed' flag is used to control this hack;\n\t\t\t// it starts out false, and is set to true after the first call to\n\t\t\t// processDatapoints.\n\n\t\t\t// Unfortunately this turns future setData calls into no-ops; they\n\t\t\t// call processDatapoints, the flag is true, and nothing happens.\n\n\t\t\t// To fix this we'll set the flag back to false here in draw, when\n\t\t\t// all series have been processed, so the next sequence of calls to\n\t\t\t// processDatapoints once again

Negative numbers don't make sense for a\npie chart, and have unpredictable results.  The values do NOT need to be\npassed in as percentages; the plugin will calculate the total and per-slice\npercentages internally.\n\n* Created by Brian Medendorp\n\n* Updated with contributions from

length, or 'auto'\n\t\t\tinnerRadius: 0-1 for percentage of fullsize or a specified pixel length, for creating a donut effect\n\t\t\tstartAngle: 0-2 factor of PI used for starting angle (in radians) i.e 3/2 starts at the top, 0 and 2 have the same result\n\t\t\ttilt: 0-1 for percentage to tilt the pie, where 1 is no tilt, and 0 is completely flat (nothing will show)\n\t\t\toffset: {\n\t\t\t\ttop: integer value to move the pie up or down\n\t\t\t\tleft: integer value to move the pie left or right, or 'auto'\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\tstroke: {\n\t\t\t\tcolor: any hexidecimal color value (other formats may or may not work, so best to stick with something like '#FFF')\n\t\t\t\twidth: integer pixel width of the stroke\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\tlabel: {\n\t\t\t\tshow: true/false, or 'auto'\n\t\t\t\tformatter:  a user-defined function that modifies the text/style of the label text\n\t\t\t\tradius: 0-1 for percentage of fullsize, or a specified pixel length\n\t\t\t\tbackground: {\n\t\t\t\t\tcolor: any
