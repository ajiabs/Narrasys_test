namespace for ng-specific state regarding\n             the various states of validity an item can be in.\n      \n             example:\n             <form ng-form=\"aForm\">\n             <input type=\"text\" name=\"firstName\">\n             </form>\n      \n             will result in an ngform object like so:\n             aForm.firstName = {$valid: <boolean>, $invalid: <boolean>, $dirty: <boolean>}\n      \n             It's hard to known the name of the textarea, because we ensure that it is unique by\n             randomly creating a name prop based upon the current time.\n      \n             this makes the following technique a little harder:\n             <p ng-if=\"aForm.firstName.$invalid\">this is a required field</p>\n             because firstName (the value of the name attribute on the text area) is randomly generated.\n      \n             the solution is to emit the name up to the directive that is consuming sxsInputI18n\n             after it has been set, then we can check the state of the validity in the parent component.\n             */\n            scope.onEmitName({ $taName: scope.textangularname });\n            if (scope.inputtype === 'textarea') {\n

away from.\n episodeEnd\t\t\t\t\ttriggered when user reaches end of episode\n play\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttriggered when user hits play\n pause\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttriggered when user hits pause\n seek\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttriggered whenever user changes the playhead position.\n seekFrom:\ttimestamp of origin\n method:\t\t\"scrubTimeline\", \"sceneMenu\", \"nextScene\", \"prevScene\", \"clickedOnEvent\".\n eventID:\tinclude if method was \"clickedOnEvent\"\n modeChange\t\t\t\t\ttriggered when episode is loaded (since default isn't always the same), and on user changes of mode\n mode: \"watch\",\"discover\",\"review\"\n playbackRateChange\ttriggered when user changes the playback speed\n playbackRate: 1\n stall\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttriggered when video playback stalls unintentionally\n lowBandwidth\t\t\t\ttriggered when we switch to a lower-bandwidth video stream due to too many stall events\n search (TODO)\t\t\t\t(search is incremental, so will have to think about how/when to capture this)\n\n event activity: captures interaction with specific transmedia items (\"events\").\n Different types of event can define their own interactions, but the core ones will be\n viewed\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplayer reached the event's start_time by any method\n interacted\t\t\t\t\tuser clicked a transmedia link, for example\n completed\t\t\t\t\t\tup to the transmedia item to
